* Why publish?
  * To let the world know about information that you have
  * For self promotion/reputation
  * For financial gain 

* Viable tech book publishers
  * O'Reilly
  * Manning 
  * Online book quality could be better

* Questionable
  * APress (recently much low-quality content)
  * Packt (see above)
  * Pearson (https://horstmann.com/unblog/2024-06-22/) 

* Authoring formats
  * Markdown probably too limited for book contents
  * AsciiDoc
  * TeX
  * (X)HTML, CSS, PrinceXML

* Self publishing
  * Leanpub
  * Lemon Squeezy
  * What about Kindle? 
  * Use provider's tool chain, or produce EPUB + quality PDF

* Reviewing
  * Don't rely on the publisher to find reviewers
  * Recruit your own
     * Experts
     * People who provided feedback to prior editions 
  * Reviewers aren't paid
  * Pay attention to critical reviews

* Promotion
  * Publishers don't do as much as they used to
  * With self-publishing, it's all your job
  * Social media, blogs, Medium/Substack
