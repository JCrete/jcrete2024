# Platform Teams - How, When, Why?

## Introduction

We focused mostly on the collaboration between stream-aligned teams and platform teams as defined in Team Topologies: https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts
* Stream-aligned team: aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the business domain
* Platform team: a grouping of other team types that provide a compelling internal product to accelerate delivery by Stream-aligned teams

## Problems

A failing platform team might not look like a failing team. They're pushing out features, quality is good etc, but all the other teams think they're holding them back.

Most of the problems can be grouped into following categories:
  * Teams are **forced** to use the platform (or some of the features)
    + Being forced to use anything results in poor solutions and high friction between the teams.
  * Platform team becomes **bottleneck**
  * Teams rebel or become **subversive**
    + It usually results in shadow platform being created by those teams
  * Software/technology starts to **stagnate**
    + Some platform teams have reluctance for change or just overwhelmed causing technological progress to halt
  * Platform teams have a reputation of being **Elite**
    + Elite vs others creates a very unhealthy culture for the company
  * Platform teams struggle to **prioritize** their work to keep other teams happy
  * **Adoption is low** (either learning curve is too big or feature is not useful)
  
## Solutions
  * Create platform (features), which are **easy to use**
  * Platform team needs to invest heavily into **selling** there vision and **advocating** for usage
  * They need to provide freedom by providing **paved road** and not blocking other ideas
  * Technology governance need to be **crowd-sourced**
  * The platform needs to be **open for outside contributes** (e.g PRs)
  * **Offsites** - learning, discussions and team building
  * **Exchanging** engineers from/to stream-aligned teams
  * Platform needs a goal and **vision**, which should take a priority over day-to-day requests from other teams
    + They need to sell the vision, so that everybody is understanding where the platform is going
  * Platform solutions should provide **self-service** experience
  
## When?
  * When special skillsets need to be centralized or efficiency
    + e.g Everybody does not need to learn how to set up a k8s cluster
  * stream-aligned teams ownership is missing/lacking towards improving the platform
  * Guilds don't work anymore
  
## Goal
Platform team goals should not be to create a feature. They should align the team behind the goals of helping others:
* Reduce cognitive load for stream-align teams
* Platform (features) is/are adopted by most teams
  + they need to have a product mindset (stream-aligned teams are the customers)
* stream-aligned teams become more efficient
* drive the technology forward (spend enough time on R&D)
